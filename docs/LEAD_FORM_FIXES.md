# Lead Creation Form Fixes

## Problem Summary

The lead creation form had several issues:
1. Duplicate `addForm` definitions causing conflicts
2. Form initialization order problems
3. Missing `addressLine2` field
4. Issues with form state management

## Solution: Fixed Lead Form Implementation

### 1. Removed Duplicate Form Definition

We found multiple instances of the `addForm` definition that were causing conflicts:

```typescript
// BEFORE: Multiple definitions of the same form
const addForm = useForm<z.infer<typeof insertLeadSchema>>({
  resolver: zodResolver(insertLeadSchema),
  defaultValues: {
    // values here
  }
});

// Later in the same file, another definition 
const addForm = useForm<z.infer<typeof insertLeadSchema>>({
  resolver: zodResolver(insertLeadSchema),
  defaultValues: {
    // different values here
  }
});

// AFTER: Consolidated into a single form definition
const addForm = useForm<z.infer<typeof insertLeadSchema>>({
  resolver: zodResolver(insertLeadSchema),
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "",
    lastName: "",
    email: "",
    phoneNumber: "",
    address: "",
    addressLine2: "", // Added missing field
    city: "",
    state: "",
    zipCode: "",
    status: "Leads", // Updated to match schema default
    leadSource: "",
    // Other fields with proper defaults
  }
});
```

### 2. Corrected Form Initialization Order

Fixed the order of operations to ensure forms were properly initialized before being used:

```typescript
// BEFORE: Form being used before fully initialized
function LeadsPage() {
  // Some state initializations
  const [addLeadOpen, setAddLeadOpen] = useState(false);
  
  // Form usage before initialization
  const handleAddSubmit = addForm.handleSubmit(async (data) => {
    try {
      // ...
    } catch (error) {
      // ...
    }
  });
  
  // Form definition after it was already used above
  const addForm = useForm<z.infer<typeof insertLeadSchema>>({
    // ...
  });
  
  // AFTER: Proper order - define the form before using it
  function LeadsPage() {
    // State initializations
    const [addLeadOpen, setAddLeadOpen] = useState(false);
    
    // Form definition first
    const addForm = useForm<z.infer<typeof insertLeadSchema>>({
      // ...
    });
    
    // Then form usage
    const handleAddSubmit = addForm.handleSubmit(async (data) => {
      // ...
    });
```

### 3. Added Missing Address Line 2 Field

```typescript
// Added to form defaultValues
defaultValues: {
  // ...
  address: "",
  addressLine2: "", // Added this missing field
  // ...
}

// Added to the form component
<FormField
  control={addForm.control}
  name="addressLine2"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>Address Line 2</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <Input placeholder="Apt, Suite, etc." {...field} />
      </FormControl>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
```

### 4. Fixed Form References in Mutations

Ensured all submit handlers and mutations were referencing the correct form instance:

```typescript
// BEFORE: Using different form instances in different places
addMutation.mutate(someFormData);

// AFTER: Consistently using the same form instance
addMutation.mutate(addForm.getValues());
```

## Effect of Changes

- Fixed lead creation form functionality
- Improved user experience when adding new leads
- Ensured all form fields are properly captured
- Fixed form validation and submission process
- Made the address fields complete with the second line for apartments, suites, etc.
