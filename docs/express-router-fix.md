# Express Router Implementation Fix

## Problem

Users with duplicate accounts (like Monica Palmer) were experiencing issues with the `/api/agents/profile` endpoint. While direct updates to `/api/agents/:id` worked, the profile endpoint consistently returned 400 Bad Request errors with "Invalid agent ID".

## Root Cause Analysis

After extensive testing, we identified the issue as an **Express route ordering problem**:

1. Express routes are matched in the order they are defined
2. The `/api/agents/:id` route was capturing requests to `/api/agents/profile` because:
   - The pattern `:id` can match any string, including "profile"
   - The ID-based route was defined before the profile route

## Solution: Express Router Implementation

We implemented a proper Express Router solution to fix the route ordering issue:

1. Created a dedicated router for agent-related endpoints:
   ```javascript
   const agentRouter = express.Router();
   ```

2. Defined the `/profile` endpoint directly on the router:
   ```javascript
   agentRouter.patch("/profile", isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
     // Profile endpoint logic
   });
   ```

3. Moved the ID-based endpoint to the router:
   ```javascript
   agentRouter.patch("/:id", isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
     // ID-based endpoint logic
   });
   ```

4. Mounted the router on the `/api/agents` path:
   ```javascript
   app.use("/api/agents", agentRouter);
   ```

## Benefits of this Approach

1. **Explicit Route Priority**: The order of route definitions on the router is guaranteed, ensuring profile requests never match the ID route.
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Organizes agent-related routes in a dedicated router.
3. **Maintainability**: Makes route priorities explicit rather than relying on implicit definition order.
4. **Scalability**: Makes it easier to add new agent-specific routes in the future.

## Verification

Comprehensive testing confirmed that:
- Monica Palmer can now successfully update her profile via `/api/agents/profile`
- The direct `/api/agents/9` endpoint also continues to work properly

## Conclusion

This fix demonstrates the importance of proper route organization in Express applications. When dealing with potentially conflicting routes, using Express Router provides a more robust and explicit way to control route matching precedence.
