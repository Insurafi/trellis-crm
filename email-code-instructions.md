# Sending Trellis CRM Code to inga@insurafi.co

We need a verified sender email in SendGrid to send emails. Here are alternative ways to share your code:

## Option 1: Use GitHub Transfer (Recommended)

GitHub allows you to transfer ownership of repositories:

1. First push your code to your GitHub account:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial Trellis CRM code"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/trellis-crm.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. Then transfer ownership:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Scroll down to the "Danger Zone"
   - Click "Transfer ownership"
   - Enter the destination username/organization
   - Follow the prompts to complete the transfer

## Option 2: Email ZIP File Manually

1. Download the ZIP file:
   - Right-click trellis-crm-export.zip in the file explorer
   - Select "Download"

2. Send email using your own email client:
   - Create a new email to inga@insurafi.co
   - Attach the downloaded ZIP file
   - Send the email

## Option 3: Use Email Service Script with Verified Sender

If you have a verified sender email with SendGrid:

1. Edit the send-code-email.mjs file:
   ```javascript
   // Replace this line
   from: 'noreply@replit.app',
   
   // With your verified sender email
   from: 'YOUR_VERIFIED_EMAIL@example.com',
   ```

2. Run the script again:
   ```bash
   node send-code-email.mjs
   ```
